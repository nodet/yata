__Yet Another Todo Application__, by Xavier Nodet <xavier.nodet@gmail.com>

Yata is a small web application written using Python and
Django.  It implements a todo list with repeatable tasks.

I started Yata mostly to discover how Web applications work.
It is written entirely using a TDD approach.

Yata is currently a single-user app: there is no 
authentication, and any one that connects to the Web
server can do anything.  I plan to change that soon.

Here is a screenshot:
