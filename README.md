__Yet Another Todo Application__, by Xavier Nodet &lt;xavier.nodet@gmail.com&gt;

Yata is a small web application written using Python and
Django.  It implements a todo list with repeatable tasks.

I started Yata mostly to discover how Web applications work.
It is written entirely using a TDD approach.

Current work involves making Yata a fully multi-user app:
authentication is implemented, and views only show items
for the user logged in.  User management is being implemented.

Here is a screenshot:
